<h2>Sass Builder</h2>
<p>The sass-builder is an Eclipse project builder base on node-sass. It will pre-compile scss from a named directory
and output css to another named directory.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Ensure you have node installed by typing node at the command prompt.</p>
<p>Navigate to the sass-builder directory and run 'npm install' from the command prompt. All dependencies should already
be installed but this will confirm the case.</p>
<h3>Set up the builder</h3>
<p>In the projects properties create a new builder as follows:</p>
